## Data sources

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/b245aa07f69c4250a2de9d24efc659e6)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/chartbrew/chartbrew?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=chartbrew/chartbrew&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

Currently, ChartBrew supports connections to these data sources.

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
* APIs that support JSON data

## Prerequisites

* NodeJS v10.16.0+
* NPM
* MySQL v5+ Server running

## Start

It is recommended you head over to the more detailed documentation to find out how to set up Chartbrew

[ðŸ“š You can find it here](https://docs.chartbrew.com/#getting-started)

## Quickstart

If you already have a MySQL server running, create a database called charbrew and adjust the parameters below with your connection settings. The command will then setup everything for you.

**Important** Windows command line is not supported at the moment. Use something like [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) on Windows.

```sh
npx create-chartbrew-app myApp --dbname="chartbrew" --dbusername="root" --dbpassword="" --dbhost="localhost"
```

The arguments are optional, but they set the environmental variables needed for the project to run. [Check out which need to be set here.](https://docs.chartbrew.com/#set-up-environmental-variables)

**Run the database migrations**

If the database parameters are correct, the migrations should run automatically. If the new database wasn't populated with tables, ensure all the environmental variables are set, then run the following command in the `server` folder:

```sh
cd server
npm run db:migrate
```

### Run the project in Development

Open two terminals, one for front-end and the other for back-end.

```sh
# frontend
cd client/
npm run start

# backend
cd server/
npm run start-dev
```

## Docker container

Open up `.env-template` in the root folder of the project and make sure that the database host var is set to `db` like so:

`CB_DB_HOST_DEV=localhost` -> `CB_DB_HOST_DEV=db`

`CB_DB_HOST=localhost` -> `CB_DB_HOST=db`

Then run the following commands:

```sh
npm run prepareSettings
docker-compose up
```
